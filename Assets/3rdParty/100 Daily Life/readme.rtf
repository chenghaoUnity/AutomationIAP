\b HOW TO START
\b0 \

First thing I must say i'm an animator, so idk if i can help much about programing TvT\
But i can explain you the overall, at least it is how i work.\
\
In 100 Daily Life package, you simply got\'a0
\i 100 clips of animations
\i0 .\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/AnimationClips.html"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 <more info about animation clips>}}\
All clips are arranged in\'a0
\i a Controller
\i0 .\'a0Also known as 
\i "State(s)"
\i0 . (not perfect, they're just be there)\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/AnimatorControllers.html"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 <more info about controller>}}
\f2\fs28 \

\f0\fs24 That controller controls the human structure, which i made it as\'a0
\i a Prefab
\i0 .\
\
You have to connect each state as you want. Something like an image {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/AnimationOverview.html"}}{\fldrslt in this link}}\cf0 \kerning1\expnd0\expndtw0 \
\cf2 \expnd0\expndtw0\kerning0
When you click at the white line between states, You can set some preferences at Inspector window.\

Hope you get some idea
